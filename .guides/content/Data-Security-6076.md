Since data in a remote warehouse is not physically in your control, there are security and privacy concerns about the data.  Being able to access data anywhere and anytime is a convenience to the end user but it also means that your data is accessible to anyone who has your password or can break into the data center’s files.

Another security concern comes from the redundant nature of the data warehouses.  If you delete a file that is stored in a data warehouse, you don’t have complete assurance that all copies of that file have been deleted.  Also, when hard drives fail, they are thrown away.  If those drives are not fully destroyed, a savoy hacker might be able to recover data after retrieving the drive from the trash.
This trade off between accessibility and security is the essential problem of a cyber security expert.  Cyber Security has a triad of goals known as CIA, Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.  

Confidentiality means that users other than you or users without granted access cannot read your data.  Assuring that data remains private is one of the central concerns of data scientists and cyber security experts.

Integrity assures users that the data they are receiving is their data and that it has not been accessed and altered or changed by anyone other than users with clearance to do so.

Accessibility addresses the issue of when and where to I have access to my data.  Data scientists and data warehouses can provide 24/7 access but that is more expensive than if the user will accept some amount of down time where their data is not accessible for maintenance or other routine issues.
