Data stored on a computer is secure in that you need physical access to that computer to open or read it.  To be able to access data anywhere in the world, it must be stored in a place that is accessible through the Internet.  This level of universal access brings convenience but also possible security issues.

## Files:
A file is an encapsulated amount of data. It is generally self-contained, having all the information it needs without going to any outside sources or finding other data.  Examples of files are text documents, images, sounds, videos, and most of the data on your personal computer is contained in files.  

## Database:
Sometimes, a lot of data needs to be organized in a way that individual entries can easily be accessed, certain data can be flagged and extracted, or data sets need to be easily analyzed.  In these cases, we can use a database.  Databases are essentially a file that has a structure, like a spreadsheet.

Databases allow us to add new data as it is generated or gathered, sort based on a given criteria, analyze for trends or behavior.  The data itself still lives in a database file but the way it is structured is different than an image, or other type of file.

## Data Warehouses:
If data is not stored on your computer, then where is it?  Often data that we refer to as “in the cloud” is really in a data center or warehouse somewhere in the world.  A data warehouse is a large building with rows and rows of servers. Most of the servers are simply hard drives used to keep copies of data and distribute the data as it is requested.  

Data centers often employ some form of redundancy, keeping multiple copies of data so that if there is a power outage, server crash, or hard drive failure, the data is not entirely lost and can be reconstructed based on backup files and multiple copies that exist.
